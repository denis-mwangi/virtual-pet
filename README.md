## 🚀 Features

- **Core Attributes**  
  - `name` — your pet’s name  
  - `hunger` — 0 (full) to 10 (very hungry)  
  - `energy` — 0 (tired) to 10 (fully rested)  
  - `happiness` — 0 (sad) to 10 (very happy)

- **Core Methods**  
  - `eat()` — reduces hunger by 3 (min 0), increases happiness by 1  
  - `sleep()` — increases energy by 5 (max 10)  
  - `play()` — requires ≥2 energy, then:
    - –2 energy  
    - +2 happiness  
    - +1 hunger  
    -`get_status()` — prints current hunger, energy, and happiness

- **Bonus Methods**  
  - `train(trick)` — teaches a new trick, stores it, +1 happiness  
  - `show_tricks()` — lists all learned tricks
